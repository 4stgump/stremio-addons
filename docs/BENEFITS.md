# Benefits of creating an add-on for Stremio

The largest benefit of creating an add-on for Stremio is distributing your content to one of the largest and easiest to use media centers.

We believe that having all the content in one place is the key to good user experience. 
We also believe that when it comes to entertainment video, great user experience is the key to building an audience. 
If we make our users use/log-in to a number of video on demand services, we are never going to reach huge retention rates.
This is why we created Stremio and the add-ons system - to introduce a way to put entertainment video in one place, in the best possible way.
