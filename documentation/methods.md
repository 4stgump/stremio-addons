# Streaming
First thing to keep in mind here is that Stremio supports video streaming through HTTP or BitTorrent-compatible descriptors. If you are interested in other protocols, contact us at [office@strem.io](mailto:office@strem.io).

# Metadata
Stremio's metadata model is designed to support movies, series and video channels (like YouTube channels). All metadata-related modules must return compatible data.
